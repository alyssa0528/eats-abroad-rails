# Welcome to the Eats Abroad restaurant recommendation app!

## Usage

The Eats Abroad Rails application is loosely based off the concept of eatsabroad.com, a site where I interviewed chefs about their favorite restaurants and bars in their cities. This app allows chefs to create a list of their favorite restaurants and share with other chefs. Chefs are required to leave a comment that provides more details on favorite dishes and other notable aspects of the recommended establishment.

## Deployed Application

Eats Abroad is deployed on Heroku. Visit https://eats-abroad-rails.herokuapp.com to play around. Use email **test@test.com** and password **test**. 

## Local Install instructions

Clone the repo. From the terminal, navigate to the eats-abroad-rails folder. Run `bundle install`. Run `rake db:migrate`. Run `rake db:seed` to populate the database with initial data. Run `rails s` and go to the specified server via your browser.
